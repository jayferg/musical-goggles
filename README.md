# musical-goggles
A repository for playing in and with github. The name is meaningless and was suggested by Github.

This is the readme file. The first two lines were created by github. I have added this bit using the inbuilt Github editor.

You can do bulletted and numbered lists quite easily:
- Cat
- Dog
- Buffalo

Task lists
- [ ] One
- [ ] Two
